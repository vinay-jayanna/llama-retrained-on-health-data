# How to Monetize Your Health Domain-Specific LLaMA Model and Get Discovered by Top Recruiters on Vipas.AI

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI applications, powering various **natural language processing (NLP) tasks**, including text generation, summarization, and question answering. **Meta's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** is one of the leading LLM architectures, designed for **efficient inference and fine-tuning**.

This guide provides a step-by-step **technical approach to fine-tuning the Meta LLaMA model (LLaMA-3.2-1B)** using a **health domain-specific dataset** and deploying it with **MLServer on Vipas.AI**. The workflow includes:
- **Dataset preparation**
- **Model fine-tuning**
- **MLflow integration**
- **Docker containerization**
- **Final deployment & monetization** on **Vipas.AI**
